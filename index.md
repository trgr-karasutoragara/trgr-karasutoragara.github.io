# future AI x dignity

**Subtitle: Two-Year Zero-Incident Report and Primary Sources**

## Project Overview and Essence

This project is a record of the support philosophy "translation of dignity through technology" born from 14 years of practical technology support for my 77-year-old mother.

From 2023 to 2025, over two years, we achieved zero fraud incidents, minimized technical troubles, and enhanced my mother's autonomy simultaneously. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the design philosophy "translation, not management" and "suggestions, not commands."

While conventional elderly support tends toward "management" or "simplification," undermining the dignity of those being supported, my approach supports technology utilization while maximizing respect for my mother's intelligence and judgment.

By publishing this practical record under MIT License, we provide concrete solutions for those facing similar challenges.
